# EchoVerse-84
EchoVerse is a web-based tool designed to convert plain written text into AI-generated audiobooks with meaningful tone adaptation and natural-sounding voice narration.

Powered by IBMâ€™s open-source Granite large language models on Hugging Face, the app intelligently rewrites the userâ€™s input into a desired tone â€” such as suspenseful, neutral, or inspiring. It then passes the rewritten text to a Text-to-Speech engine to produce an audio narration, which users can listen to, download, or compare with their original version.

EchoVerse supports:

ðŸ“„ Uploading .txt files or pasting text

ðŸŽ­ Tone selection for creative expression

ðŸ§  LLM-based intelligent rewriting

ðŸŽ§ Multilingual audio narration via gTTS

ðŸ•“ History tracking of past narrations

ðŸ”— GitHub-friendly, API-free deployment

Whether itâ€™s for educational accessibility, creative storytelling, or just fun â€” EchoVerse makes audiobook creation simple, smart, and voice-driven.
